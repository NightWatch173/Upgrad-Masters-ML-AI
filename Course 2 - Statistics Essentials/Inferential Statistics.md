## Discrete Probability Distributions

### Binomial Probability Distribution

Phrasing the conditions more formally, the binomial distribution can be used if, for an experiment:

- The total number of trials is fixed
- Each trial is binary, i.e. has only two possible outcomes, success and failure
- The probability of success is the same for all the trials
